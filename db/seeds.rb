# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# Career Options:
# When you press wizard, you need to land on a page to enter two career options
# Submit, then user creates two career options
# Need to create an object of options

# seed for 3 users with name, email, password = password
